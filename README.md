# Profils

‘Profils’ is an android application, which uses the concept of Geo Fencing. It automatically enables or disables the ringer modes of the phone if it enters specific location. For example, whenever you go to school, your phone will be automatically put on silent mode and once you come out it will set back to the previous ringing mode.
Goal of the app is to make user free of setting the profile each time. This app uses Network Provider or Wi-Fi to get your current location and changes the way your phone behaves. So, you don’t have to remember things.
